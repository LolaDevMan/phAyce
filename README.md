For our Space Jam project we decided to make a an automated door using a mask detector. When a person comes near the door, a motion sensor detects the person and turns on a camera, that scans the persons face and checks if he is wearing a mask. An Arduino opens the door for the person if he is wearing a mask, and sets off a buzzer if he isn't.
